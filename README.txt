My custom report gathers information of how many appointments are taking place in each of the possible appointment locations, and
displays the report in a tableView table with two columns, a column displays the location name, and the second one displays how many
appointments are taking place at that particular location.

You need an active internet connection to use this application, as it connects to an online SQL database.
To run this application, please execute the fille called FranciscoScheduler.jar
